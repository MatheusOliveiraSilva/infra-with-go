# Phase 01: Go Core

This phase focuses on developing core Go skills including:

- Go toolchain and modules
- Basic syntax and structures
- Testing
- Concurrency with goroutines and channels

## Projects

- **[go_stat](./go_stat)**: Simple CLI that demonstrates goroutines, channels, and signal handling
- **[memory_status](./memory_status)**: Program that monitors and displays memory statistics using Go's runtime package

## Additional Learning Resources

- **[network/network.md](./network/network.md)**: Comprehensive guide on networking concepts using the OSI model, with Go examples for each layer
- **[linux/linux_revision.md](./linux/linux_revision.md)**: Essential Linux command reference for development and operations

## What We Learned

- Setting up Go modules with `go mod`
- Working with command-line flags
- Implementing goroutines for concurrent execution
- Using channels for communication between goroutines
- Handling OS signals for graceful program termination
- Working with `sync.WaitGroup` to manage goroutine lifecycles
- Collecting system memory statistics using `runtime.MemStats`
- Writing basic Go tests with table-driven testing
- Understanding networking fundamentals with Go implementations
- Utilizing Linux commands for development environments
