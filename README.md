# go-infra-lab

A **hands‚Äëon roadmap** to mastering modern infrastructure using **Go**. This repository tracks my journey from absolute beginner to advanced topics, split into progressive phases. Each phase lives in its own folder and comes with a dedicated README containing code, commands, and lessons learned (this following plan was customized based on what i want to learn and what i want to build, by o3 openai model, using chatgpt plus).
